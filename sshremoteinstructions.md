steps to using vscode to modify code on remote servers without having to be confined to terminal output or being forced to use vim:
1.) install OpenSSH https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse
2.) install Remote - SSH  vs code extension from market place
3.) open your vscode settings and enable  remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal
4.) open command palate (f1) and search for Remote-SSH: Connect to Host
5.) enter host info
6.) connect!

thought i'd put this here for my own reference, also in case you guys are interested.
